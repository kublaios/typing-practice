# Why?
I occasionally change my keyboard and need to practice to get up to speed. Existing solutions are not customizable enough, so I built my own, where you can fetch random quotes from Lit Ipsum API or enter your own text.
## Just write more code?
We both know that's not how it works.
# How to contribute?
If you add functionality, feel free to open a PR. For everything else, use [issues](https://github.com/kublaios/typing-practice/issues).
