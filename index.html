    <h5>How to use</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Hit 'Use random quote', or</li>
        <li>Enter your own text above and hit 'Use my own text'</li>
        <li>Start typing, and the displayed text will turn green/red based on the correctness of your input</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Known limitations</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Lit Ipsum API for the random quotes does not allow repeated requests within a short timeframe. If you need a new quote, you have to wait for ~5 seconds</li>
        <li>Although there is a sanitization logic for some special characters like double quotes, you might still encounter other characters which you can't replicate in your keyboard. You'll have to copy-paste them or request a new text. The best is to report them <a href="https://github.com/kublaios/typing-practice">here</a> (or create a pull request) so we can include them during sanitization.</li>
        <li>New lines are also a bit bumpy. The current comparison isn't smart enough to match them, so keep that in mind and avoid them whenever you can.</li>
        <li>Sorry that the app does not congratulate you in any way, or give you your typing speed. Maybe one day...</li>
    </ul>
